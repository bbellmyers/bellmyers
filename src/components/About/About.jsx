        <h2>Freelance Art Director, designer and illustrator 1990-present</h2>
        <h3>Darcy Bell-Myers Illustration & Design</h3>
        <p>
          I have been a freelance illustrator and graphic designer for many years now, specializing in illustration for
          children, including educational and editorial illustration. I have worked on a variety of projects both
          fiction and non-fiction including illustrated storybooks, early readers, bookcovers, magazine covers and
          interior illustrations, stickers, bulletin board trimmers, post-cards, games, puzzles, animated cartoons,
          educational software and much more! In addition I have worked as an animator and college instructor through
          the years which has helped to round-out my experience and give me added insight and expertise in these areas.
          Some of my clients include; Instructional Fair, McGraw Hill, The Meadowbrook Press, Abrams/Learning Trends,
          Carson Dellosa, VoWac Publishing, Attitude Press, Family Times/Senior Times/Grandparent Times/BabyTimes,
          Minnesota Monthly, MInnesota Parent, Minnesota Medicine, Twin Cities Parent and City Pages

        <h2>Art Director:</h2>
        <h3>Instructional Fair / TS Denison &Co., 1992-2000</h3>
        <p>
          I started with this company when it was a small business producing primarily books for the supplemental
          educational market and grew with it as it tripled the amount of products released each year and stretched into
          the mainstream market. I worked on a variety of projects from initial conceptualization to finished product.
          My input in the process began with coming up with ideas, titles and budgets for projects; I then worked
          creating layouts, illustrations, and graphic design, hired and supervised other artists, designers and
          computer programmers as needed; and finished with the supervision of film-production and press-checks. I
          gained a firm foundation in this job that serves me well to this day.

        <p>
          I taught a class entitled "Professional Practices" in my downtime. It was a class for senior illustration and
          graphics students designed to help them with the daily challenges of being a graphic artist. I gave them
          real-life projects such as those they might be assigned at a publisher, with a focus on showing portfolios,
          communicating with art directors, creating intelligent pencil sketches and the intricacies of faxing,
          invoicing and creative problem-solving.

          sequences for television commercials, and participated in the conceptualization of character designs and story
          boards for clients such as Leviï¿½s and Best Buy. I aided in the post production transfer of animation from film
          to video, in ink and painting of cels as well as produced background art.
